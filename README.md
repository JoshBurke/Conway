# Conway's Game of Life
I've decided to try my hand at this historically significant simulation. I've always been fascinated by the concept of emergence and Conway's Game is a nice demonstration of this.
This project is also serving as my first solo web project.

Going forward with this project I'd like to optimize the simulation first and foremost. It runs pretty slow at this point. Another task would be to automate the process of finding repeating patterns - running the simulation for a few thousand iterations and then locating patterns with period > 2.

## Functionality:
As of now, each time the page is loaded it has a random seed. Click to play/pause.

You can run the simulation by clicking [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/JoshBurke/Conway/blob/master/docs/index.html).
