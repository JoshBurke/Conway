# Conway's Game of Life
This is my work-in-progess implementation of Conway's Game of Life. I've always been fascinated by the concept of emergence, and Conway's Game is a nice demonstration of how simple processes can work together to become more complex.
This project is also serving as my first solo web project.

Going forward with this project I'd like to optimize the simulation first and foremost. It runs pretty slow at this point. Another task would be to automate the process of finding repeating patterns - running the simulation for a few thousand iterations and then locating patterns with period > 2. I'd also like to add options for seed density, seed serializing/deserializing, replaying seeds, starting new seeds *without* refreshing, and maybe some time controls once the simulation is fast enough. Once I learn more about common repeaters I think it would be cool to be able to load examples of them as seeds, so that someone new to the game could learn about them as well.

## Functionality:
As of now, each time the page is loaded it has a random seed. Click to play/pause.
